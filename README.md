# Real-time face Recognition Using Facenet On Tensorflow 2.X

This is a quick guide of how to get set up and running a robust real-time facial recognition system using the Pretraiend Facenet Model and MTCNN.

1. Make a directory of your name inside the Faces folder and upload your 2-3 pictures of you.
2. Run ``` train_v2.py```.
3. Then run ```detect.py``` for realtime face recognization.



# Dependencies
This code was working properly on tensroflow 2.3.0.
